      <p>This savoury and spicy dish from a restaurant called Mama’s Kitchen uptown was definitely one of my favourites this month. Tucked away in a tiny neighborhood, this restaurant was definitely quite a local secret! The flavours of this dish were extremely strong yet balanced, with amazing aromatics I could smell from outside the restaurant! The noodles were well-cooked, the sauce was not too salty, and the fresh herbs were truly noticeable. This dish is not for the weak, with its extremely spicy flavours brought out by red chili peppers, peppercorn, and dried pepper flakes. If I lived close, I would come every day!

      <p>Had to line up early to get a spot in line at this five star michelin restaurant. The noodles were extremely springy and were served with their famous homemade sauce, which was a perfect balance of sweet and salt. It was served with pork and fungus wontons along with choy sum, making the meal so whole and hearty tasting. Reminds me of noodle bowls I had back in hong kong and it was perfectly recreated at this restaurant. I highly recommend this to anyone who's looking for some tasty noodles as it was so worth the hour wait in line! However, beware of the extremely smokey smell in the restaurant! I had to wash my clothes twice to get rid of the terrible reek.

      <p>Having read raving reviews for this restaurant on BlogTO, I had high expectations. Sadly, they did not meet them. The noodles tasted average, but were expensive for such a small portion. The Shanghai noodles did not taste like they were from Shanghai. They rather tasted like the Buzzfeed Tasty recipe I make when I am low on ingredients. On the upside, the dishes were Instagram worthy and they had excellent service!
